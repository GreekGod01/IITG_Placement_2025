Interesting Resources : 

1) [Shivam's KnowledgeBase](https://github.com/Shivam5022/Knowledgebase-SV) - Consider this the holy grail for systems preparation. Of course some of the topics are too detailed or rarely asked so you need to choose the relevant ones.
2) [Implementations](https://github.com/LegendsDen/Implementation-C-) - An exhaustive list of all systems related implementations. Some are directly asked to be implemented while ideas of others are discussed . Helpful to go through them all.
3) [Website](https://bequant.dev/) - Its quant developer section (Free for a month) has an exhaustive set of ALL systems topics. Not so good for a first time read but very good to brush up and study selective topics.
