## Round 1 ( Technical & onsite )

**Duration :** 60 - 70 mins

There were 2 interviewers, both were relatively frinedly.

### 1)

First they asked about intern experience in quite detail.
They were asking questions (not related to tech stacks) on that so prepare it properly.

### 2)

Then asked a DSA question :-
given 2 arrays representing maths and physics marks of students, a student is considered failed if there exists another student
who has strictly more marks in maths and physics.
Find the number of failed students.
Asked me to write code for it on pen and paper.

### 3)

Asked about memory management in C++ in detail.

### 4)

Asked to explain 3 way TLS handshake.
Follow-ups were about the encryption used, encryption certiicate and its verification.
( They were just curious if I knew the last part )

### 5)

Asked to explain various forms of normalization along with examples.

## Round 2 ( Technical & onsite )

**Duration :** 60 - 70 mins

### 1)

Even they asked about the intern experience though not in so much details as the previous interviewers did.

### 2)

Then asked a DSA question :-
given a directed graph along with a source node and a target node, find the minimum number of edges that need to
be reversed to get a directed path from source to target.
I explained my approach using 0/1 BFS so had to explain that and its difference from Djkstras as well.

### 3)

Then asked a system design question
(They were asking this to everybody from this year).
Asked me to implement a food delivery application, just the
classes, their methods & attributes along with their visibility and relations.
They were particularly interested in the placement of various attributes and their
visibility).

### 4)

Asked about the various steps in compilation process
( It was a project in my CV ).

## Verdict

**Accepted**

## Tips & preparation resources

### 1)

Firstly, be confident in your introduction and smile if you can.
A guy seemed to pass all the technical rounds but was rejected for being too "casual"
by the HR ( whatever that means ).
So try to be a little engaging and sincere.

### 2)

Interview questions vary depending on the interviewer's interest but one thing is common -
they always ask at least a few questions on your resume so be very thorough with it.
Another guy had written OS project so they started going too deep into it which he couldn't answer.
Be prepared for such a scenario.

### 3)

Their main focus is on core CS fundamentals.
If you are really well versed with these, it will be a cakewalk for you.

Topics including :-

* **a)** OS / C++ / OOPS
  ( They make it a point to ask some questions from this so be prepared )

* **b)** DBMS
  ( very high chance of being asked normalization questions )

* **c)** Networks
  ( They also made it a point to ask everyone atleast a few networks questions.
  In this you are rarely asked in too detail but you need to be
  aware of every topic, every layer and every protocol )

* **d)** System Design
  ( They only started asking this in our year and this is the only company that asks this
  so don't make it priority.
  Seeing a few Low level system design examples can help.
  It also helps to know the very basic design patterns like singleton, builder, factory
  etc but really not necessary.
  They mainly focus on your thought process and most people who cleared had no prior knowledge of this. )
