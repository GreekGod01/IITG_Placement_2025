Google Offcampus 
Duration - 45 min 
Remarks ;- Interviewer asked no other questions and jumped directly to the DSA question 

Question ; - Find the endpoints of the subbaray such that for all i , j such that A[i] == A[j] , subarray sum [i,j] is maximum 
First assume positive numbers and 0 . 

Tips :-
  
-> Try to take care of edge cases on your own
-> Practice on Google Docs . Try to keep the spacing consistent as well 
-> Undersatand the problem and ask clarifying questions before starting to code  
-> Sometimes the intervitewer asks ambiguous questions so u need to drill down the problem scope 
-> maintain code cleanilness and proper variable namimg .Can use both types of naming
   Pascal ( for classes, structs and enums ) 
   Camel ( for variable and methods)   
-> if read only function can use const modifier for parameters 
-> Analyse space ( Auxiliary and input ) and time complexity while discussing tradeoffs)
-> spacing should be consistent and clear 
-> first write comments while explaining layout of code to interviewer 


Can refer to attached material shared by interviewer for preparation ( mostly see behavioural and sample code )
